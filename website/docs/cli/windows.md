# Windows and WSL

The package runs on Windows 10/11 with Node.js 20 or later, from PowerShell or cmd.

- The settings file lives in `%APPDATA%\signoz\.env`, protected by that folder's per-user permissions (file modes
  mean nothing on Windows).
- `signoz mcp boot enable` registers a logon task.
- `signoz mcp stop` asks the server to shut down through a token-guarded `POST /shutdown` before falling back to
  terminating it: a signal on Windows is `TerminateProcess`, which would not let the server shut down.
- The client CLIs are run through `cross-spawn`, so Windows `.cmd` shims work.
- Files are written through a rename that retries, because antivirus and editors hold files open.

## From WSL

When the package is installed inside WSL, `signoz mcp install` and `uninstall` also list the clients installed on
the Windows side, as `Claude Code (Windows)` and so on (`--client claude@windows`). They start the server with
`wsl.exe -d <distro> -e node …/dist/mcp/cli.js`, so it keeps reading the configuration saved inside WSL. The first
call after WSL has been idle waits for the distro to start (a second or two).

The Windows side is reached through `powershell.exe`, taken from the PATH or, with `appendWindowsPath = false`,
from `/mnt/c/Windows/System32/WindowsPowerShell/v1.0/`. When it cannot be reached, `--client claude@windows` says
which step failed.

To start the server at login inside WSL, enable systemd in `/etc/wsl.conf` first, then run
`npx signoz mcp boot enable`.
